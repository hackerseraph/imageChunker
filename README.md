If theres anything that bugs me, its pixelated images uploaded to a social media platform, especially if it makes text unreadable. Every now and again I find myself with a very long portrait dimensioned image that I want to upload to facebook, but I dont want to take the time to spin up photoshop, or GIMP just to split it up into square chunks and upload it. I'm lazy, so here's a little python based image slicer, that spits out 500px x 500px chunks.
